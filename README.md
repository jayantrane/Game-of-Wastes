## Introduction:

Game of waste is an android game, purpose of which is to act as a competitive game in which users conquer territories within a city by contributing towards waste management and thus gain tokens. Users with maximum tokens in the region conquer the territory!

The application involves crowdsourcing in the following way:
Users detect illegal dump
Properly disposing plastic waste to nearby shopkeepers
(Involves Image processing to detect if the image is of waste only and QR code for user identification)
User with maximum tokens can see themselves as the conquerers on the map.

We have implemented two app

1.Game Of Waste:
Three users can sign in:

Garbage host

Users

Municipal Corporation(To view images uploaded by users and distribute tokens)

Detection of illegal dumps and disposal of plastic waste properly to garbage host
Garbage host can verify the dump using the Garbage detector too.

2. Garbage Detecter: Used to verify image is a garbage image or not using image processing.
The tokens can be used at different places.
