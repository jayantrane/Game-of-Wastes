## Introduction:

Game of waste is an android game, purpose of which is to act as a competitive game in which users conquer territories within a city by contributing towards waste management and thus gain tokens. Users with maximum tokens in the region conquer the territory!

The application involves crowdsourcing in the following way:
Users detect illegal dump
Properly disposing plastic waste to nearby shopkeepers
(Involves Image processing to detect if the image is of waste only and QR code for user identification)
Users with maximum tokens can see themselves as the conquerers on the map.

# Themes used:

Gamification

Crowd Sourcing

Image Processing

Principles of sharing economy


Users Of Game of waste:
1.Garbage host: One who keeps the garbage collection bin, to whom users approach and thus distribute tokens to users.

2.End user: dispose of plastic to hosts

3. Municipal Corporation: Distribute tokens to hosts and users for crowdsourcing and maintain leaderboard according to numbers of tokens collected by users



## Unique Selliing Points:
Involves gamification and thus waste management implicitly
Plastic waste can be reduced to a high extent
Plastic management has been focused
QR code has been used for user identification
The map has been used to show the territories
Image processing has been used to detect illegal dumps, problem for which a lot of applications do not focus on

## Future Scope :

A global leaderboard can be maintained for all the users
The tokens can be exchanged for various other commodities 
The apps can be merged to provide a single platform
Blockchain can be used to maintain the supply management of tokens improving transparency
The kings of the territory would be plotted on the map thus improving ui.
